# Hashing in Data Structute
- asing is a technique in DS that efficiently retrieves data in a way that allows for quick access

## components of Hashing
- key
- hash function
- hash table

> key
unique value inside a hash table that defines an index or location for storage of an item in a data structure
>
Hash Function
- K mod 10 (major)
- K mod 2 (major)
- Mid-square

Example
```
keys = 42,19,10,12
no of keys = 4
1st Hash Function(k mod 10)
1st key = 42
42 mod 10 = 2 // 42 is stored in index 2
```
